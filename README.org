* Nix Home Lab
This repository is a configuration for servers running in my home network.
At present, it runs NixOS on a single unit of Raspberry Pi 3B.
** Usage
[[https://github.com/zhaofengli/colmena][Colmena]] is used to build and deploy images.

First allow direnv in the project directory and then run

#+begin_src sh
  colmena build
  colmena apply
#+end_src

to switch to the latest configuration.
