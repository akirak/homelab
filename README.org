This repository contains the configuration files of my NixOS machines.
** Features

- Targeting various hosts (both cloud and physical). See below.
- Containing images for bootstrapping
- Using [[https://docs.cachix.org/deploy/][Cachix Deploy]] for agent-based, pull-style automated updates
** Host environments
- Laptop (ASUS BR1100C)
- Hetzner Cloud
- +Raspberry Pi 3B+â€‹
- QEMU for prototyping configuration
** Note
To provision a new virtual machine instance to Hetzner Cloud, I use Terraform.
I have a continuous deployment setup on GitHub Actions, but the configuration is not part of this repository.
